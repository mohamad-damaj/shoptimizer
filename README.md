## Inspiration

Often when we shop online, we lack a perspective of the objects from various directions and we may be unable to imagine the object in 3D.

## What it does

Thats why we built PolyShop, we turn any Shopify Store into a immersive 3D experience with realistic objects utilizing AI

## How we built it

Python, TypeScript, FastAPI, NextJS, Gemini, Redis, Celery

## Challenges we ran into

Throughout this hackathon, we learned a lot about how AI task orchestration works using tools like task queues, workers and message brokers to help facilitate GenAI API calls.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Using technologies, patterns, and APIs we were not familiar with before the hackathon
- Building out the idea after pivoting in the first day

## What we learned

- Lots about task queues and their function.
- Lots about Shopify, especially their developer APIs and portals
- Lots about the possibilities of GenAI

## What's next for PolyShop

- Creating vast worlds that users can walk and explore
- AR/VR
